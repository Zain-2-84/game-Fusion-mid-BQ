# gameFusion-mid-BQ:
This is our games and accessories website, where we offer plenty of games, accessories, and a login page. 

We chose a dark theme because black has a unique receding quality, causing brighter colors to stand out and instantly grab the viewer's attention.

In the Games page, we divided our games into two categories, namely free-to-play and paid ones, with four games in each. Each game has its own description, OS, Processor, Memory, Hard disk space, price, and we also added Select element to allow users to select a product multiple times at once and the option to either Add to cart or Purchase directly (excluding free-to-play ones).

In the Accessories page, we divided into four categories namely, Keyboards, mice, mouse pads, and headphones. We also mentioned eight brands to let our audience know what to expect. Afterwards, each product category has four items, which belong to two brands each. We also added Add to cart and Purchase option in here as well.

In the Login page, we chose a dark gaming background to make gamers both begineers and advanced feel more relatable. Then we added a simple login with user email, password, "I accept all the terms and conditions." checkbox, and Login button.
